        "The provided dataset from Kaggle[1] presents detailed information about video games. It is a rich collection of information about popular titles, player preferences, and trends in the gaming industry. It contains 1512 rows and 14 columns (which is in line with the presented requirements). Column Table showing the title for each game, which allows for the analysis of the popularity of individual titles. In turn, the Release Date allows for tracking the release of games over the years, the most common release date in the data is November 12, 2020, which may be related to the wave of premieres related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Team column contains information about all the teams responsible for developing games. Out of 764 unique teams, the most popular is “Capcom” (34 times). Rating shows the average rating for users, the range of those ratings is from 0,7 to 4,8. The most common grade was 4,1 with average 3,72. Time Listed and Number of Reviews represents interested players in specific games. Dataset contains values like “1,4K” which will be converted into correct numbers. Column Genres represents information about game types, contains 255 unique values, the most popular are “Adventure” and “RPG”. Summary contains detailed plot summaries and game mechanics, enabling semantic analysis, which can be useful in studying player expectations for narrative games and sandboxes. Reviews have 1117 unique values of opinions from players about the game. Plays, Playing, Backlogs and Wishlist contains information about players activity. Plays represent the number of players who played that specific game, Playing from the other hand players who are still playing that game. Backlogs and Wishlist can be interpreted as future interest in games.\n",
        "The dataset contains a small number of missing elements, 13 missing values ​​in the Rating column and 1 missing value in the Abstract column. The impact on the reliability of the analysis is minimal, and the missing ratings can be replaced with average values ​​from similar games. Applying thorough data analysis to this particular dataset seems to be valuable for the game development industry. Proper analysis will allow companies not only to identify the most important aspects of games, but also to choose appropriate marketing strategies.\n",
